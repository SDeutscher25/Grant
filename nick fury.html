            Colonel Nicholas Joseph "Nick" Fury Sr. is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published
            by Marvel Comics. Created by writer/artist Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee, he first appeared in Sgt. Fury
            and his Howling Commandos #1 (May 1963), a World War II combat series that portrayed the cigar-chomping man
            as leader of an elite U.S. Army Ranger unit. The modern-day character, initially a CIA agent, debuted a few
            months later in Fantastic Four #21 (December 1963). In Strange Tales #135 (August 1965), the character was
            transformed into a James Bond-like spy and leading agent of the fictional espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The
            character makes frequent appearances in Marvel books as the former head of S.H.I.E.L.D., and as an
            intermediary between the U.S. government or the United Nations and various superheroes. It is eventually
            revealed that he takes a special medication called the Infinity Formula that halted his aging and allows him
            to be active despite being nearly a century old, later leading to him becoming The Unseen, herald of Uatu
            the Watcher, and forming a new team of Exiles.

            Nick Fury appears in several Marvel series set in alternate universes, as well as multiple animated films,
            television shows, and video games based on the comics. The character was first portrayed in live-action by
            David Hasselhoff in the television film Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (1998), with Andre Braugher
            portraying General Hager, a character based on Fury, in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007).
            Jeff Ward also portrayed Deke Shaw, a character based on the original Fury, from the fifth to the seventh
            season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

            A version of the character appearing in Marvel's 2001 Ultimate Marvel imprint was based on Samuel L.
            Jackson's appearance and screen persona. When the character was introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
            in 2008's Iron Man, Jackson was cast in the role, which he has played in eleven films, the first season of
            Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013â€“14), and the Disney+ series What If...? (2021) and Secret Invasion (2023). The
            recognizability of the character portrayed by Jackson in the films later led Marvel in 2012 to retire the
            original character from his role with S.H.I.E.L.D., replacing him with his son Nick Fury Jr., who is also
            patterned on Jackson.

            Promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. by Alexander Pierce, Fury focused his efforts over the next fifteen
            years to organize the Avengers Initiative, intending to bring together powerful individuals to protect Earth
            from extraterrestrial threats. Despite reluctance from World Security Council, Fury recruited Iron Man and
            Captain America. With the Avengers ready, Fury called on them when Earth was invaded by Loki, who
            brainwashed an army and stole the Tesseract. Fury led the Avengers' hunt for Loki, as they attempted to
            learn what Loki's plan was and who he had been working for. This came to a head following Phil Coulson's
            death, as Loki was tracked to New York City. There, the Avengers engaged Loki and his Chitauri army, with
            Fury keeping the World Security Council from nuking the city before Loki was defeated and the Avengers were
            disassembled.
