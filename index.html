The name John Doe dates back to medieval England, originally used in legal cases as a placeholder for unknown or anonymous parties, especially in land disputes. Alongside Richard Roe, John Doe allowed courts to discuss hypothetical scenarios without naming real people.

Today, John Doe is widely used beyond the courtroom. Hospitals use it for unidentified patients, law enforcement for unknown suspects or bodies, and it often appears in everyday language to represent an anonymous or generic person.

The name helps maintain privacy and manage situations where someoneâ€™s identity is unknown or needs protecting. Over centuries, John Doe has become a symbol of anonymity, proving how a simple fictional name can hold lasting significance.
