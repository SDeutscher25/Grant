    <h2>Christmas</h2>
    <p>
    Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25 
        as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A liturgical feast central 
        to Christianity, Christmas preparation begins on the First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by Christmastide, 
        which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday 
        in many countries, is observed religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as celebrated culturally by many non-
        Christians, and forms an integral part of the annual holiday season.

        <h2>Story of Christmas</h2>
    <p>
    The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was 
        born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no 
        room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, 
        who then spread the word.    
    </p>

    <h2>Theories</h2>
    <p>
    There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth. In the early fourth century, the church fixed the date as December 25, 
        the date of the winter solstice in the Roman Empire. It is nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the Roman date of the spring 
        equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars
        used in countries throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian 
        calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, celebrating that God came into the world in the form
        of man to atone for the sins of humanity is more important than knowing Jesus's exact birth date.

        <h2>Traditions</h2>
        <p>
            The customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular 
            holiday traditions include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching Christmas movies; 
            viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations, 
            including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, poinsettias, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several related 
            and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to 
            children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas 
            festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. 
            Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.
