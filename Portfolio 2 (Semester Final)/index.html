        <p>
            I was born in Denver Colorado on September 14, 2009. I lived in Denver for half of my life until we moved to
            Austin Texas. We lived in Austin for a good while, and finally we made the move up to Sheridan, Wyoming. As
            you could guess, I tend to enjoy the city more than the country, but Sheridan offers a lot more than I
            thought. I march in the SHS Marching Band, and I'm going to Hawaii in November of 2026 to march for Wyoming
            in the All-State Marching Band. I'm a cadet in the Cloud Peak Squadron, a squadron of the Civil Air Patrol.
            I'm a C/A1C (Airman 1st Class) in the program right now, I'm eligable for another promotion as soon as I get
            back from Japan. I want to serve in the US Air Force in the near future and fly the newly announced F-47. It
            will be fully operational a year after I graduate, which gives me time to become a commissioned officer in the Air
            Force.
